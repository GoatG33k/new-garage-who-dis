# Supported Notifications
*New-Garage-Who-Dis* supports the following notification resources by default:
- [**T-Notify**](https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify) **(Recomended)** T-Notify offers numerous advantages over any other notification system and has well written [Docs](https://docs.tasoagc.dev/#/). This is the suggested notification system to be used. Please ensure you're on the latest version.
- [**Mythic-Notify**](https://github.com/FlawwsX/mythic_notify) This resource uses `SendALert` and not the old way of `DoHudText` so this version is **required** if you want to use *Mythic-Notify*.

##### The below Notification Systems use [Floating Notifications](https://i.imgur.com/ZcDa6KV.jpg) for prompts since they lack simple persistant alerts while retaining their respective notifications for success/error notifications.
- [**pNotify**](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-pnotify-in-game-js-notifications-using-noty/20659) 
- **ESX Notifications**
